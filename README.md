# Axelar: Tough Questions

![Screenshot](public/toughscreen.png)

Tippi created this simple starter for his presentation using the create-next-app as template, inspired by https://www.tutorai.me/

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/gpt). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/gpt.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Next Steps

Clean up the code. Use loops to process the returned modules

- _title 1_description is right here blah blah blah_another field you need_another one_ another one
- _title 2_description is right here blah blah blah_another field you need_another one_ another one
- _title 2_description is right here blah blah blah_another field you need_another one_ another one
  const modulesArr = data.split(\*)
  loop
  in each one
  make a new variable in loop for module split
  const module = split("\_")
  module[0] title
  module[1] description

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
