# Axelar: Tough Questions (Starter)

![starting image](public/starterimage.png)

Tippi created this simple **starter-branch** for his presentation using the create-next-app as template, inspired by https://www.tutorai.me/

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## How I did it:

1. First, I scraped out the index.js from the nextJS starter and filled it with my idea and "brand".
1. Then, I used state variables to conditionally render the 4 modules onClick of the Ask button.
1. Then I updated this readme and my presentation!
1. For the final version, check out: [rendered-gpt branch](https://github.com/tippi-fifestarr/tough-questions/tree/rendered-gpt) or [main Vercel deployment](https://tough-questions.vercel.app/)

## Getting Started

> npm install

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
